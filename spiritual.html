		 <p style="font-size:15px;">Spiritual Readings: $50 explores the power and possibilities of the image, and is a reflection on memory and the more-than-human world. Through experimentation with various camera technologies, installation techniques, and digital manipulation, questions arise about the inherent power held within photographs based on their form and context. The photographs themselves almost exclusively depict rural sites and subjects in Manitoba, and they work together to create new relationships and meaning about them. Themes of memory and nostalgia are explored, and the traditions of landscape photography are pushed and challenged through phenomenological, somatic, and ecological considerations and perspectives. Spiritual Readings: $50 questions the form of photography and its uses, and asks if empathy is something that can be conjured through it.</p>
