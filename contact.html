    <p>Skye Callow is an artist based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She primarily works with photography and lens-based practices. Her work investigates formal aesthetics and the ways in which form generates and communicates meaning in images. Callow’s practice considers hierarchies of beauty and value within image-based visual culture, while seeking to disrupt accepted conventions in contemporary photography. She is fascinated by film grain and the digital pixel, and often utilizes both analog and digital photographic processes in her work. She is a constant experimenter, influenced and inspired by the approach of experimental filmmaking, with her practice often shifting between mediums and techniques.
