    <p>Skye Callow is an artist based on Treaty 1 Territory in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Through image making, assemblage, and installation practices, her work explores the magic of our ecological and metaphysical worlds and engages in the somatic experience of being in relation to the biosphere; a motif of ecology, self, and the land continuously presents itself. Skye is currently investigating the subjects of ecological empathy and hyperobjects, and the limits and possibilities of perception. Skye holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts Honours Degree from the University of Manitoba's School of Art.
