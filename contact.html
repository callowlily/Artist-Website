    <p>Skye Callow is an artist based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She primarily works with photography and lens-based practices. Her work investigates the formal aesthetics of the image, the ways in which form generates and communicates meaning, and attempts to derail accepted conventions in photography. She is currently fascinated with the digital pixel in relation to film grain, and is curious about what dictates beauty in the hierarchy of image-based visual culture; particularly in that of camera created and digitally constructed images. She is a constant experimenter, influenced and inspired by the approach of experimental filmmaking, with her practice often shifting between mediums and techniques.
